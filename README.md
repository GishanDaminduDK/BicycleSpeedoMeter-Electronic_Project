Welcome to the Bicycle Speedometer project's README! This project is the result of my fourth-semester individual effort.

## Overview

The bicycle speedometer presented in this design report is a versatile and essential tool for cyclists. It accurately measures and displays vital cycling metrics in real-time. The primary focus of this product is to provide cyclists with critical information, including:

- Speed
- Time
- Temperature
- Humidity

This enhances their cycling experience and promotes environmentally-friendly transportation.

## Features

By integrating various sensors, this bicycle speedometer empowers cyclists to monitor their cycling performance effectively:

- Reed switch sensor for speed measurement
- DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity readings
- OLED display for real-time data presentation

The speedometer's functionality extends beyond speed measurement. It includes features like:

- Time display
- Temperature and humidity readings

This allows cyclists to plan and optimize their rides under different weather conditions.

## Safety First

Moreover, the addition of a proper horn system enhances safety during cycling. It alerts others and prevents potential accidents. The utilization of the Atmega328P microcontroller ensures accurate data processing and smooth operation of the speedometer.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bicycle-speedometer.git`
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Upload the code to your Atmega328P microcontroller.
