Welcome to the Bicycle Speedometer project's README! This project is the result of my fourth-semester individual effort.

## Overview

The bicycle speedometer presented in this design report is a versatile and essential tool for cyclists. It accurately measures and displays vital cycling metrics in real-time. The primary focus of this product is to provide cyclists with critical information, including:

- Speed
- Time
- Temperature
- Humidity

This enhances their cycling experience and promotes environmentally-friendly transportation.

## Features

By integrating various sensors, this bicycle speedometer empowers cyclists to monitor their cycling performance effectively:

- Reed switch sensor for speed measurement
- DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity readings
- OLED display for real-time data presentation

The speedometer's functionality extends beyond speed measurement. It includes features like:

- Time display
- Temperature and humidity readings

This allows cyclists to plan and optimize their rides under different weather conditions.

## Safety First

Moreover, the addition of a proper horn system enhances safety during cycling. It alerts others and prevents potential accidents. The utilization of the Atmega328P microcontroller ensures accurate data processing and smooth operation of the speedometer.

Happy cycling!
